# Portfolio

I have a bachelor's degree in data science, with minors in computer science, math, and statistics from Montana Technological University. I have years of experience with Python and the standard data science libraries and am proficient in C++ and C#, as well as lower level languages such as R and SQL. I have worked on projects from social network analysis to deep neural networks to cryptography, using both supervised and unsupervised learning.
