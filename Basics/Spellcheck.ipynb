        "Spellcheck is a program I originally wrote in C++ for a data structures class. It was the intro assignment so the teacher could get some insight into our skill levels and background. The expectation was something basic like a list or a binary tree, my solution was still fairly basic but in my opinion a bit more elegant. Spellcheck creates a tree based on the spelling of the words instead of the words themselves, a node contains a letter, and then each node has an array with 27 positions signifying each letter of the alphabet as well as a stop value, the array is initialized full of null values, and then adjusted when loading the dictionary of words.\n",
        "\n",
        "The benefits of my solution are that the search time is based on the length of the word, not the size of the dictionary, and it could easily be adapted for a more real word problem where letters are input one at a time. The only real negative I see is the structure is large, and takes more memory than a simpler structure.\n"
